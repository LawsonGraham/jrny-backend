# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

(backend) npx hardhat test - run test files
(backend) npx hardhat node - run a local node, initialize the bunch of test accounts
(backend) npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost - deploys nftMarket contract
(backend) npm run backend - json-server --watch db.json
