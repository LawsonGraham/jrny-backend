This repository contains the Backend for JRNY's V1 MVP, including the the the off-chain consumer data stored using a MongoDB Database, and the on-chain contracts used to facilitate DAO investment and NFT sales.

## Structure

Active development occurs in this repository, which means the some aspects of the backend might not be production-ready at times. Most of the mock data used for the MVP is private and thus can't be cloned by anyone, however all of the Schema is here to allow for mock data creation.
